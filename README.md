Real Time Sign language Detection with TensorFlow Object Detection

Real-time sign language detection with TensorFlow Object Detection is a cutting-edge application of deep learning that offers a bridge for communication between the deaf and hearing communities.
By leveraging pre-trained object detection models fine-tuned to recognize sign language gestures, this technology captures video frames in real-time, interprets sign gestures, and facilitates instant communication.
This innovative approach has the potential to break down communication barriers, making sign language more accessible and inclusive, while exemplifying the transformative power of artificial intelligence in addressing
real-world challenges.
